The-Mobile-Stage
================

"The  Mobile  Stage"  is  an  iOS  application  for  audience  use  during  interactive,
mixed­media  theatrical  productions  and  performance  art  installations.  It  is  designed  to
foster  greater  engagement  between  theatre  audiences and performers by expanding the
creative scope for live performance into augmented reality.
Audiences  use  the  camera  of  their  devices  to  see  a  user­selected  avatar  of  a
“digital  performer”  who  is  projected  onstage  via  Augmented  Reality.  The  digital
performer  interacts  with  physically  present actors as if they were really there, telepresent
onstage in mixed reality.
At  key  moments  in  the  narrative,  audiences  will  be  given  the  opportunity  to  vote
on  storyline  changes.  The  production  crew  will  communicate  the  results  to  the  cast,
allowing the audience to dramatically influence the course of the play.
Audiences  will  be  able  to  comment  on  the  action  and  share  their  experience
online  using  in­app  social  media  integration.  The  production  crew  can  also  use  social
media  to  connect  with  the  audience,  providing  commentary  to  supplement  the  narrative
or clues for their future choices.
